# **OVERVIEW**

This project takes in movie data and displays the box art and a link to the trailers on an HTML page it generates. 

## **QUICKSTART**

1. To run the program, make sure you have Python (version 2) on your machine.
2. Download the files [media.py](https://github.com/chikeezeh/Project_Movie_Trailer/blob/master/media.py), [entertainment_center.py](https://github.com/chikeezeh/Project_Movie_Trailer/blob/master/entertainment_center.py), and [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/chikeezeh/Project_Movie_Trailer/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) and include them in the same folder.
3. Run the [entertainment_center.py](https://github.com/chikeezeh/Project_Movie_Trailer/blob/master/entertainment_center.py) file to generate the HTML page.
4. To customize the output, make changes to the Movie instances declared in [entertainment_center.py](https://github.com/chikeezeh/Project_Movie_Trailer/blob/master/entertainment_center.py) and also change the movies list object to the new instances created.
